WEATHERPY – OBSERVABLE DATA
In completing this exercise, I found three major observations from the data: 

•	Trends seen with City Latitude vs Max Temp: As expected, the Max temperature varies based on latitude with tendencies of a higher max temperature as you approach the equator, highest at the equator and then starting to decline as you descend from the equator. 
•	Trends seen with City Latitude and Wind Speed: It appears that a larger share of the sample of cities has a wind speed ranging from 0 -15 mph, however there doesn’t seem to be any indication that wind speed has a relationship with latitude. This might have the possibility of varying during different times of year.
•	Trends seen with City Latitude vs Humidity: It appears that a larger share of the sample of cities has a humidity level ranging from 60 -100%, regardless of their latitude.  Also noting that cities at the equator seem to reflect a humidity levels of at least 40% or above. This might have the possibility of varying during different times of year.
